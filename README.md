# GE-IK

IK_1.ipynb - A simple IK solver using the PSO algorithm, demonstrating which tools we can use or compare with results from Grammatical Evolution

Fitness function: I suggest using the Euclidean distance for the first tests, and we will be using x,y,z coordinates

Grammar i guess?

```
<expression> ::= <angle>, <angle>, <angle>, <angle>, <angle>, <angle>

<angle> ::= <number>

<number> ::= -3.14 | -1.57 | -0.78 | 0 | 0.78 | 1.57 | 3.14
```

Note: number should have much bigger range
